## ARMS: Low Bit Coding and Echo Hiding Watermarking Implementation in wav audio file

This application was created in 2007, used as tool to help me to analysis data for my undergraduated thesis. With many request from people sent to my email, facebook and linked in, asked to share my work, so I decided to share the source code on Github.

This project was developed using Java, and use NetBeans for IDE. I dont touch Java for years now, so I'm not sure if this project still compatible or can opened by latest NetBeans IDE

Please notice that this project is far away from being perfect, so dont excpect anything high with this project.
